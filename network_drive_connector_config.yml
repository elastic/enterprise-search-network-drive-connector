#Specifies the objects to be fetched and indexed in the Enterprise search along with fields that needs to be included/excluded. The list of the objects with a pattern to be included/excluded is provided. By default all the objects are fetched
include:
exclude:
#The timestamp after which all the objects that are modified or created are fetched from the Network Drive. By default, all the objects present in the Netowork Drive till the end_time are fetched
start_time : "2021-12-09T15:14:28Z"
#The timesstamp before which all the updated objects need to be fetched i.e. the connector wonâ€™t fetch any object updated/created after the end_time. By default, all the objects updated/added till the current time are fetched
end_time : "2021-12-16T15:14:28Z"
#The interval after which the connector looks for new/updated objects from Network Drive. The unit of the interval is minutes. By default, the interval is considered to be 60 minutes
indexing_interval: 60
#The interval after which the connector looks for the deleted objects from Network Drive. The unit of the interval is minutes. By default, the interval is considered to be 60 minutes
deletion_interval: 60
#The interval after which the connector fetches all the objects from the Network Drive from a given start_time in the configuration file to the current time

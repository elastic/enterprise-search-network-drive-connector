"""Checkpointing module allows to start sync from point in time.

    Checkpointing module contains functions that allow to manage checkpoints,
    such as set a checkpoint and get a checkpoint.

    Checkpoints help with incremental or interrupted synchronizations,
    remembering the last moment of time when sync successfully finished,
    so that later next sync can continue from that place.
